Supports adding hooks to any element in the DOM, which then can be exported to both PNG and JSON formats for downstream use.\r\n\r\nTo use, simply include `<script src=\"prints.js\"></script>` and setup your loged events\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n#### \"Hello world\"\r\nCreate a new prints that should POST logs to port 5000 on localhost\r\n```JAVASCRIPT\r\nvar points = new Prints(\"http://localhost:5000\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhenever the user clicks, create circle with diameter 10 around that location.  Also, log the information in a time series.\r\n```JAVASCRIPT\r\npoints.createNewTracker(document, \"onclick\", {color: \"red\", size: 10, shape: \"circle\", logEvent: true});\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen the user tries to exit the page, send their interactions to a safe place.\r\n```JAVASCRIPT\r\nwindow.onbeforeunload = function() {\r\n  points.sendLoggedPng\r\n  points.sendLoggedEvents\r\n}\r\n```\r\n",
